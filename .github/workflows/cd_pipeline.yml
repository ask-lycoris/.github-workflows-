    # Ensure CI has passed before deploying.
    # This assumes your CI job is named 'build-and-analyze' in the 'ci_pipeline.yml' workflow.
    # If your CI and CD are in the same file, you can use `needs: build-and-analyze`.
    # If they are separate files, this check is implicitly handled by only triggering CD on 'main'
    # after PRs (which run CI) are merged.
    # For more explicit control with separate files, you might consider workflow_run or reusable workflows.
    # For simplicity here, we rely on the 'main' branch protection rules (requiring CI checks to pass).
